# Week-1-Challenge

## Description

During this firs weekly challenge, we went over adding comments into HTML and CSS code to make it clear as to what each class/section was doing.
This is helpful as a guide to make learning a little more visual. I also used the Scout Rule to consolidate classes and try to leave the code a little cleaner/easier to read.
Here is a screenshot showing examples of the comments added into the CSS file.
